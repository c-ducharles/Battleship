# Battleship (2019)
A python based version of the Battleship Game

To run the game, Python is required on the computer.

To lunch it, go into Battleship-Game and then run the Battleship.bat that will then lunch all the other required files.
The Battleship-Rapport contains an HTML version of our report of the project.

Enjoy !
